# Group Project-WellnessTracker Data Analysis Project
## Project Overview
Our project showcased the entire data cleaning, analysis, and visualization process using Python. We began by cleaning the **WellnessTracker** dataset by handling missing values, managing outliers in daily steps, and standardizing numerical data. In the analysis phase, we performed various statistical calculations, such as ratios, median income differences, and custom metrics like **ActivityEfficiency** to gain insights into customer behaviors. For visualization, we created several plots, including pie charts, histograms, bar plots, heatmaps, jointplots, and box plots, to effectively illustrate our findings. 

Overall, our goal was to demonstrate essential and advanced data handling techniques, apply solid statistical methods, and use clear visualizations to uncover meaningful patterns in the data.
